# Integration tests

The integration test is inspired on [js-ipfs-preload-tester](https://github.com/mcamou/js-ipfs-preload-tester).
However, while `js-ipfs-preload-tester` uses one IPFS node running in-process in
Node.js and a second one running in a browser controlled via Puppeteer, this test
runs 2 nodes in Node.js. The reason for this is that the browser does not support
WebSockets without a valid SSL certificate, which entails adding Nginx or a similar
revers proxy into the mix, and I have been unable to make it play nice with a
self-signed one.

What the test does is:

- Start two js-ipfs nodes connected to a preload proxy
- Add some content on one of the nodes (the content includes a timestamp to ensure
  that it is different every time)
- Fetch the CID from the other node and verify that the content matches

## Running the test

1. You will need NodeJS
1. Start a go-ipfs node
1. Compile Kitsune with `go build`
1. Start Kitsune in preload mode: (This assumes that go-ipfs is listening on localhost:5001)

    `go-libp2p-kitsune -d /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001 -l /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/24001 -w /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/28080 -p 25001`

1. `cd integration/tester; npm install`
1. Start the integration test:

   `npm start -- --api-addr=/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/25001 --bootstrap-addr=/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/28080/ws/p2p/<Kistsune_peer_ID>`

If everything goes well, you should see something similar to the following:
